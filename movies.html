<h1>The Best Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>In Shari's humble opinion.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Selena: The Movie</h3>
<p>Heart-wrenching. Epic retelling of magnificent talent snuffed out to soon.</p>
<h3>Mad Buddies</h3>
<p>Hilarious. Great characters. Highly recommend.</p>
<h3>Mean Girls</h3>
<p>Absolute classic. Must watch at least once in your lifetime.</p>
