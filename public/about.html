<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In high school, I took computer classes, mostly working with Python, which was my first introduction to programming.
</p>

<p>I never thought that I would aspire for a career in information Technology. Since graduating from high school and saving for college, I was aiming to study Business Administration, which sounded professional and mature, even though it was slightly cryptic..</p>

<p>One night, I was researching careers that made the most money, then careers that were going to be needed in the future, and both had the same answer. Computer Science.
  That night, it seemed like something suddenly clicked. Like I had finally found a what I was supposed to do(not just for the financial benefits). This was a field I had prior experience with; one that fits my personality. I am currently two months in, and most days I find the syntax of certain programming languages fascinating, other days, not so much. I'm just starting out on my journey and I can't wait to see what I achieve in the future.
